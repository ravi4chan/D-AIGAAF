# Operational Context

## 1. Purpose

Operational Context defines the circumstances in which an AI capability is expected to operate and the conditions that may affect its performance, risk, human control and authority.

AI performance is not independent of context.

A system that performs acceptably in a controlled environment may behave differently when exposed to:

- degraded information;
- unfamiliar environments;
- adversarial conditions;
- communication loss;
- sensor degradation;
- time pressure;
- unexpected human behaviour;
- changes in mission conditions.

Operational Context therefore forms a critical input to risk assessment, TEVV, assurance and operational authorisation.

---

## 2. Core Principle

The governing principle is:

> **AI assurance is valid only in relation to the mission, use case and operational conditions for which the relevant evidence has been established.**

Operational Context should be defined before claims of operational suitability are made.

---

## 3. Context Dimensions

D-AIGAAF operational context should consider, as applicable:

1. Mission context
2. Geographic context
3. Environmental context
4. Information context
5. Communications context
6. Human context
7. Technical context
8. Adversarial context
9. Time context
10. Legal and policy context
11. Dependency context
12. Consequence context

These dimensions may interact and should not be assessed only in isolation.

---

## 4. Mission Context

Mission context describes the operational purpose within which the AI capability is being used.

It should identify:

- mission objective;
- mission criticality;
- supported activity or decision;
- operational phase;
- expected users;
- consequences of error;
- consequences of non-availability;
- authorised autonomy.

The same capability may require different assurance or authority for different missions.

---

## 5. Geographic Context

Geographic context should identify the physical area and characteristics relevant to system performance.

Where applicable, consider:

- geographic boundaries;
- terrain;
- elevation;
- urbanisation;
- infrastructure;
- proximity to sensitive locations;
- mapping quality;
- positioning availability;
- movement patterns;
- seasonal variation.

Geographic transfer should not be assumed to preserve performance.

Evidence established in one geographic environment may not automatically support use in another.

---

## 6. Environmental Context

Environmental conditions can materially affect AI performance.

Relevant conditions may include:

- temperature;
- humidity;
- precipitation;
- dust;
- smoke;
- snow or ice;
- fog;
- darkness;
- glare;
- vibration;
- altitude;
- water exposure;
- electromagnetic conditions.

Testing should include environmental conditions relevant to the intended operational envelope.

---

## 7. Information Context

AI systems depend on the quality, availability and integrity of information.

The context should identify:

- available data sources;
- data quality;
- data completeness;
- data latency;
- data provenance;
- data integrity;
- conflicting information;
- missing information;
- expected data drift;
- classification or handling constraints.

An AI system may produce technically valid output from information that is operationally wrong, incomplete or manipulated.

Information integrity is therefore part of operational risk.

---

## 8. Communications Context

The context should define communications assumptions.

Consider whether the system operates:

- continuously connected;
- intermittently connected;
- disconnected;
- offline;
- with delayed communications;
- with bandwidth constraints;
- with degraded communications;
- with loss of communications.

The effect of communications loss should be explicitly defined.

If communications failure can alter AI behaviour, autonomy or human control, it must be addressed in requirements, testing and authorisation.

---

## 9. Human Context

The operational context should identify the human conditions surrounding AI use.

Relevant factors may include:

- number of users;
- user competence;
- workload;
- fatigue;
- time pressure;
- stress;
- training;
- experience;
- availability of specialist support;
- ability to challenge AI outputs;
- ability to intervene.

Human presence does not necessarily constitute meaningful human control.

---

## 10. Technical Context

The technical environment should identify relevant system conditions.

These may include:

- hardware;
- software;
- model version;
- configuration;
- interfaces;
- sensors;
- compute resources;
- power;
- storage;
- network dependencies;
- external services;
- update mechanisms.

The authorised configuration should be identifiable and traceable.

---

## 11. Adversarial Context

AI systems may operate in environments where another actor deliberately attempts to influence system behaviour.

Potential conditions include:

- manipulated inputs;
- spoofing;
- deception;
- adversarial examples;
- poisoned data;
- malicious instructions;
- compromised dependencies;
- cyber attack;
- deliberate disruption;
- attempts to cause loss of control.

Adversarial assumptions should be documented and tested according to consequence.

---

## 12. Time Context

Time can affect both AI performance and the consequences of error.

Consider:

- response-time requirements;
- decision windows;
- rapidly changing situations;
- stale information;
- latency;
- update frequency;
- duration of operation;
- time available for human review.

A recommendation that is accurate but arrives too late may still be operationally ineffective.

---

## 13. Legal and Policy Context

Operational use must remain within applicable:

- law;
- national policy;
- defence policy;
- doctrine;
- directives;
- rules and procedures;
- data-handling requirements;
- safety requirements.

D-AIGAAF does not create legal authority.

Operational authorisation cannot exceed the authority available to the implementing organisation.

---

## 14. Dependency Context

Critical dependencies should be identified.

These may include:

- external data;
- satellites or positioning services;
- communications infrastructure;
- cloud services;
- third-party software;
- third-party models;
- supplier support;
- specialist personnel;
- maintenance;
- power;
- navigation systems.

A dependency that can materially affect mission performance should be included in risk and resilience assessment.

---

## 15. Operational Degradation

The context should describe conditions in which performance may degrade.

Examples include:

- reduced sensor quality;
- missing data;
- communications loss;
- reduced computing capacity;
- unfamiliar conditions;
- increased workload;
- adversarial interference;
- model uncertainty;
- system faults.

The capability should define whether degradation results in:

- continued operation;
- reduced functionality;
- reduced autonomy;
- human confirmation;
- controlled degradation;
- transition to a safe state;
- suspension.

---

## 16. Context Combinations

Operational conditions can interact.

For example:

**Poor visibility + degraded sensors + communications loss + time pressure**

may create a substantially different risk environment from each condition considered separately.

TEVV and assurance should therefore consider important combinations of conditions where these combinations are reasonably foreseeable.

---

## 17. Context Boundaries

Every consequential AI use case should define the limits of the operational context for which authority is granted.

These may include:

- geographic limits;
- environmental limits;
- communications limits;
- data limits;
- time limits;
- system configuration;
- autonomy;
- human availability;
- mission conditions.

Operation outside these boundaries should trigger the appropriate escalation, restriction or reauthorisation process.

---

## 18. Context and Risk

Operational context is a direct input to risk.

A simplified relationship is:

**Mission + Use Case + Context → Risk**

Context can increase or decrease:

- likelihood of failure;
- severity of consequence;
- uncertainty;
- human ability to intervene;
- system resilience;
- required assurance;
- required operational authority.

Risk should therefore not be assessed solely from model characteristics.

---

## 19. Context and TEVV

TEVV should progressively expose the system to conditions representative of the intended operational context.

A generic progression is:

**Laboratory → Controlled → Representative → Adversarial → Operational Environment → Mission-Level Evaluation**

Testing should establish which operational conditions are:

- demonstrated;
- partially demonstrated;
- unsupported;
- unknown.

Unsupported or unknown conditions should not silently be treated as safe.

---

## 20. Context and Human Authority

Human authority must remain meaningful within the actual operational context.

For example, a human may technically have an override function but lack meaningful control if:

- intervention is too slow;
- communications are unavailable;
- the operator lacks required information;
- the system acts faster than the human can respond;
- the operator cannot understand the AI output sufficiently to make a decision.

Human-control claims should therefore be evaluated under realistic operational conditions.

---

## 21. Context and Autonomy

The appropriate autonomy level depends partly on operational context.

The same autonomy level may have different consequences in:

- a low-risk administrative environment;
- a contested operational environment;
- a system affecting physical infrastructure;
- a system capable of consequential action.

Changes in environment may therefore require changes in autonomy, controls or authorisation.

---

## 22. Context and Situational Awareness

AI systems supporting operational decision-making should provide sufficient contextual information for human decision-makers to understand:

- what the system observed;
- what information it used;
- what it does not know;
- how uncertain the output is;
- what limitations apply;
- whether the current conditions are within the demonstrated operating envelope.

Situational awareness should support, not replace, human judgement.

---

## 23. Context and Loss of Control

Operational context should consider how loss of control could occur.

Potential causes include:

- unexpected model behaviour;
- compromised inputs;
- software failure;
- communications loss;
- human unavailability;
- cascading system failures;
- malicious manipulation;
- unauthorised modification.

The context assessment should identify the consequences and the available protective measures.

---

## 24. Context Change

Operational context should be reassessed when there is a material change.

Examples include:

- new environment;
- new geography;
- new mission;
- new data source;
- new sensor;
- new communications architecture;
- increased adversarial activity;
- significant change in human workload;
- change in autonomy;
- change in system behaviour.

Context change may require additional TEVV, risk reassessment, revalidation or reauthorisation.

---

## 25. Operational Context Record

A consequential AI capability should maintain an Operational Context Record containing, as applicable:

- mission;
- geographic conditions;
- environmental conditions;
- information conditions;
- communications;
- human factors;
- technical configuration;
- adversarial assumptions;
- time constraints;
- legal and policy constraints;
- dependencies;
- degradation conditions;
- operational boundaries;
- known uncertainties;
- evidence supporting context claims.

---

## 26. Minimum Operational Context Requirements

Before consequential operational use, the following should be defined:

1. Intended mission context.
2. Geographic boundaries.
3. Relevant environmental conditions.
4. Information and data conditions.
5. Communications assumptions.
6. Human operating conditions.
7. Technical configuration.
8. Adversarial assumptions.
9. Time constraints.
10. Critical dependencies.
11. Degradation behaviour.
12. Operational boundaries.
13. Legal and policy constraints.
14. Evidence demonstrating suitability for the intended context.

## 27. Relationship With D-AIGAAF

This module connects directly with:

- `02 Mission & Use Case/Mission_Definition.md`
- `02 Mission & Use Case/Use_Case_Definition.md`
- `03 Risk & Autonomy`
- `04 AI Lifecycle`
- `05 Data & Information`
- `06 AI Security`

Operational Context is also a critical input to the D-AIGAAF Golden Thread:

**Mission → Use Case → Requirements → Risk → Controls → Testing → Evidence → Assurance → Authority**

---

## 28. Summary

An AI capability does not operate in a vacuum.

Its reliability, risk and human-control requirements depend on the environment in which it is actually used.

D-AIGAAF therefore treats operational context as a first-class governance input:

**Mission + Use Case + Operational Context → Risk → Assurance → Authority**

The central rule is:

> **Evidence of performance in one context does not automatically establish suitability in another.**

Operational authority should remain bounded by the conditions under which the capability has been appropriately assessed and authorised.
