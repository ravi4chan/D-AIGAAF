# D-AIGAAF — Risk Governance

**Document:** Risk Governance  
**Framework:** D-AIGAAF — Defence AI Governance, Assurance & Operational Authorisation Framework  
**Status:** Working Draft v0.1  
**Classification:** Generic / Unclassified

---

## 1. Purpose

This document defines the governance approach for identifying, assessing, treating, accepting, monitoring and escalating risks associated with defence AI capabilities.

It establishes the organisational principles that govern risk decisions before the detailed risk methodology is applied in `03 Risk & Autonomy`.

The central proposition is:

> **Risk is not merely a technical property of an AI system. It is a function of the capability, mission, environment, autonomy, human authority and consequences of failure.**

---

## 2. Risk Governance Philosophy

D-AIGAAF treats risk governance as a continuous decision process.

The objective is not to eliminate all risk. Defence operations inherently involve uncertainty and risk.

The objective is to ensure that:

- significant risks are identified;
- risks are understood in operational context;
- controls are proportionate;
- residual risk is visible;
- the appropriate authority accepts the risk;
- assurance evidence supports the decision;
- changes in circumstances trigger reassessment.

Risk should therefore be considered throughout the AI lifecycle rather than only before deployment.

---

## 3. Risk Governance Objectives

Risk governance should:

1. establish clear ownership of AI-related risks;
2. distinguish technical, operational, security, legal and strategic risks;
3. connect risk with assurance requirements;
4. connect risk with decision authority;
5. prevent unacceptable risks from being hidden within aggregate scores;
6. ensure uncertainty is explicitly represented;
7. establish escalation thresholds;
8. define risk acceptance authority;
9. provide mechanisms for continuous reassessment;
10. preserve evidence of consequential risk decisions.

---

## 4. Risk Is Context-Dependent

The same AI system may present different risks in different circumstances.

For example, a capability may have:

- low risk in a training environment;
- moderate risk in a controlled operational environment;
- high risk when supporting time-critical decisions;
- substantially higher risk when granted autonomous authority.

Therefore:

> **Risk cannot be determined solely from the model or technology.**

The risk assessment must consider the relationship between:

**Capability × Mission × Environment × Autonomy × Human Authority**

---

## 5. Risk Dimensions

D-AIGAAF uses the following conceptual risk dimensions.

### 5.1 Consequence — C

What is the potential consequence if the AI capability fails, behaves unexpectedly or is misused?

Indicative scale:

- **C1 — Negligible**
- **C2 — Minor**
- **C3 — Serious**
- **C4 — Severe**
- **C5 — Catastrophic**

Consequences may include:

- loss of life;
- serious injury;
- mission failure;
- damage to critical infrastructure;
- compromise of sensitive information;
- strategic effects;
- unintended escalation;
- loss of control.

### 5.2 Autonomy — A

How much independent decision-making or action is delegated to the AI?

Indicative working construct:

- **A0 — No meaningful AI decision**
- **A1 — Information / observation**
- **A2 — Analysis / recommendation**
- **A3 — Recommendation or action requiring explicit human authorisation**
- **A4 — Executes predefined actions under human supervision**
- **A5 — Independently makes consequential decisions or actions**

This is a D-AIGAAF working construct and should be validated against applicable established terminology before institutional adoption.

### 5.3 Mission Criticality — M

How important is the AI capability to successful mission execution?

Indicative scale:

- **M1 — Administrative / non-critical**
- **M2 — Supporting**
- **M3 — Operationally important**
- **M4 — Mission-critical**
- **M5 — Strategically critical**

### 5.4 Operational Environment — E

How demanding is the environment in which the capability operates?

Indicative scale:

- **E1 — Controlled**
- **E2 — Representative**
- **E3 — Complex**
- **E4 — Degraded / contested**
- **E5 — Extreme / adversarial**

Environmental considerations may include:

- communications availability;
- sensor degradation;
- weather;
- terrain;
- electromagnetic conditions;
- cyber threat;
- adversarial manipulation;
- incomplete information;
- degraded infrastructure.

### 5.5 Human Control — H

How effectively can an authorised human understand, intervene in and control the AI capability?

Indicative scale:

- **H1 — Immediate and effective intervention**
- **H2 — Rapid intervention**
- **H3 — Delayed or constrained intervention**
- **H4 — Limited meaningful intervention**
- **H5 — No meaningful immediate intervention**

Human control must be assessed in the actual operational environment, not merely demonstrated in a laboratory.

---

## 6. Risk Categories

D-AIGAAF recognises multiple overlapping risk categories.

### 6.1 Mission Risk

Risk that AI performance adversely affects mission objectives.

### 6.2 Safety Risk

Risk of physical harm to personnel, civilians or other protected persons.

### 6.3 Operational Risk

Risk arising from actual employment conditions, including degraded or adversarial environments.

### 6.4 AI Security Risk

Risk arising from manipulation, compromise, exploitation or loss of control of the AI capability.

### 6.5 Information Risk

Risk arising from inaccurate, incomplete, corrupted, manipulated or poorly governed information.

### 6.6 Autonomy Risk

Risk arising from inappropriate delegation of decision-making or action to AI.

### 6.7 Legal and Policy Risk

Risk that employment violates applicable law, policy or delegated authority.

### 6.8 Supply Chain Risk

Risk arising from suppliers, dependencies, opaque components, updates or compromised provenance.

### 6.9 Strategic Risk

Risk that AI employment produces effects beyond the immediate mission, including escalation or strategic consequences.

### 6.10 Human-AI Interaction Risk

Risk arising from inappropriate trust, over-reliance, automation bias, misunderstanding or ineffective human intervention.

---

## 7. Inherent Risk

**Inherent Risk** is the risk associated with a capability before considering mitigating controls.

The assessment should consider:

- consequence;
- likelihood where meaningful;
- autonomy;
- mission criticality;
- environment;
- human control;
- uncertainty;
- potential failure modes;
- adversarial conditions.

Inherent risk provides the starting point for determining the required level of control and assurance.

---

## 8. Controls

Controls are measures intended to reduce risk or limit its consequences.

Controls may be:

- technical;
- procedural;
- organisational;
- human;
- physical;
- security-related;
- contractual;
- environmental;
- operational.

Examples include:

- access controls;
- input validation;
- model monitoring;
- human confirmation;
- restricted autonomy;
- geographic or mission restrictions;
- redundancy;
- fail-safe mechanisms;
- controlled degradation;
- independent testing;
- operator training;
- configuration management.

Controls should be assessed for effectiveness rather than assumed to work merely because they exist.

---

## 9. Residual Risk

**Residual Risk** is the risk remaining after applicable controls have been implemented and their effectiveness considered.

The core relationship is:

**Inherent Risk → Controls → Residual Risk**

Residual risk should be expressed in a manner that allows the appropriate authority to understand:

- what remains uncertain;
- what could still go wrong;
- how severe the consequences could be;
- how effective the controls are;
- what assumptions the assessment depends upon.

---

## 10. Risk, Assurance and Authorisation

D-AIGAAF establishes a deliberate chain:

**Risk → Required Assurance → Evidence → Assurance Conclusion → Authorisation Decision**

Higher-consequence capabilities should generally require stronger evidence.

Higher autonomy should generally require stronger evidence.

More demanding operational environments should generally require stronger evidence.

Reduced human control should generally require stronger evidence.

However, these relationships should not be reduced to a single automatic numerical rule without validation.

---

## 11. Risk Appetite and Risk Tolerance

An implementing organisation should define:

### Risk Appetite

The broad level and types of risk the organisation is prepared to accept in pursuit of its objectives.

### Risk Tolerance

The acceptable variation around a defined risk position for a specific capability or mission.

### Risk Acceptance

The explicit decision by an appropriately authorised authority to accept a defined residual risk.

Risk appetite does not automatically authorise an individual capability.

Risk acceptance must remain linked to the specific capability, mission and authority.

---

## 12. Risk Acceptance Authority

Risk must be accepted by an authority with sufficient:

- legal authority;
- delegated authority;
- operational understanding;
- accountability;
- understanding of the consequences.

Technical personnel may identify and mitigate risk without possessing authority to accept the resulting operational risk.

Similarly, an operational commander should not be expected to accept a highly technical risk without access to appropriate technical and assurance advice.

---

## 13. Risk Escalation

Risk should be escalated when:

- residual risk exceeds delegated tolerance;
- consequence is catastrophic or potentially irreversible;
- evidence is insufficient;
- uncertainty is material;
- human control is inadequate;
- autonomy exceeds the authorised level;
- the capability operates outside its authorised environment;
- a new failure mode is discovered;
- a significant incident occurs;
- security compromise is suspected;
- legal or policy authority is uncertain;
- risk is disputed by competent functions.

Escalation should occur before risk becomes an operational surprise.

---

## 14. Risk Acceptance Hierarchy

The exact organisational hierarchy is implementation-specific.

A conceptual structure is:

**Operator / User**
→ accepts routine procedural risks within established controls

**Operational Commander**
→ accepts operational risks within delegated authority

**Operational Authorising Authority**
→ accepts risks associated with operational authorisation

**Strategic / Enterprise Authority**
→ accepts risks exceeding lower-level delegated authority

The hierarchy must be defined explicitly by the implementing organisation.

---

## 15. Uncertainty as a Risk Factor

D-AIGAAF treats uncertainty as information.

An AI system should not be considered reliable merely because it produces a confident output.

Governance should identify uncertainty relating to:

- data quality;
- model behaviour;
- operating conditions;
- adversarial conditions;
- system dependencies;
- generalisation beyond tested conditions;
- human interpretation;
- predicted outcomes.

Where uncertainty is material, it should influence:

- operational restrictions;
- human control requirements;
- assurance requirements;
- risk acceptance;
- monitoring;
- reauthorisation.

---

## 16. Unknown Unknowns

AI systems may encounter situations that were not anticipated during development or testing.

D-AIGAAF therefore does not assume that developers can enumerate every future use case or failure mode.

Governance should instead provide mechanisms to:

- detect unexpected behaviour;
- identify emerging risks;
- escalate uncertainty;
- restrict employment;
- collect operational evidence;
- update assurance;
- reassess authorisation.

The objective is not perfect prediction of every failure.

The objective is to maintain the ability to detect, contain and govern failure when it occurs.

---

## 17. Operational Environment as a Risk Variable

An AI capability should not be assumed to have the same risk profile across all environments.

Relevant conditions may include:

- conventional operations;
- irregular or counter-insurgency operations;
- own territory;
- contested territory;
- mountains;
- high altitude;
- glaciers;
- deserts;
- jungles;
- maritime or amphibious environments;
- degraded communications;
- intermittent connectivity;
- denied networks;
- adversarial electronic conditions;
- degraded or misleading sensor inputs.

The framework remains generic and does not prescribe classified operational scenarios.

---

## 18. Risk and Human Authority

Risk increases when human intervention becomes more difficult.

Governance should therefore consider:

- decision time available;
- communication delay;
- operator workload;
- quality of situational awareness;
- ability to understand AI output;
- ability to override;
- reliability of override mechanisms;
- consequences of delayed intervention.

A nominal human-in-the-loop arrangement may provide little meaningful control if the human cannot realistically understand or intervene before consequences occur.

---

## 19. Risk of Loss of Control

Loss of control should be treated as a distinct and potentially high-consequence risk.

Examples may include:

- AI acting outside intended parameters;
- unauthorised expansion of functionality;
- manipulation of inputs;
- compromise of model or system behaviour;
- unexpected interaction with other systems;
- inability to stop consequential actions;
- autonomous behaviour that cannot be adequately explained or constrained.

Controls should address both prevention and recovery.

---

## 20. Risk Treatment

Risk treatment options include:

### Avoid

Do not deploy or use the capability for the proposed mission.

### Reduce

Modify the capability, environment, autonomy or controls to reduce risk.

### Transfer / Allocate

Assign defined responsibilities or contractual obligations to another party while retaining appropriate accountability.

### Accept

Explicitly accept residual risk through the appropriate authority.

### Restrict

Permit employment only under narrower conditions.

### Suspend

Temporarily stop operational employment pending reassessment.

### Reauthorise

Re-establish authority after the risk and assurance position has been reassessed.

Risk treatment should be selected according to the specific risk rather than through a predetermined preference.

---

## 21. Risk and Autonomy

Autonomy should be treated as a risk multiplier or risk driver where it increases the ability of an AI system to independently produce consequential outcomes.

As autonomy increases, governance should examine:

- consequence;
- human control;
- reversibility;
- decision speed;
- predictability;
- system boundaries;
- failure containment;
- ability to intervene;
- evidence supporting autonomous behaviour.

Autonomy should never be increased solely because the technical system can support it.

---

## 22. Risk and Mission Criticality

Mission criticality should influence governance intensity.

A failure in a non-critical administrative capability may be inconvenient.

A failure in a mission-critical capability may:

- compromise an operation;
- expose personnel to harm;
- degrade situational awareness;
- cause incorrect decisions;
- create cascading system failures.

Mission criticality should therefore influence assurance depth, monitoring, redundancy and authorisation conditions.

---

## 23. Risk and Data Integrity

Data integrity is an operational risk issue.

Risk assessment should consider:

- source reliability;
- provenance;
- completeness;
- timeliness;
- corruption;
- manipulation;
- sensor error;
- adversarial inputs;
- conflicting sources.

An AI system can produce technically valid output from invalid or manipulated information.

Therefore:

> **Reliable computation does not guarantee reliable operational information.**

---

## 24. Risk and Supply Chain

Risk governance should consider the complete AI supply chain.

This may include:

- model developers;
- software components;
- hardware;
- cloud or infrastructure providers;
- datasets;
- pretrained models;
- APIs;
- third-party libraries;
- update mechanisms;
- maintenance providers;
- critical dependencies.

Where a supplier or dependency can materially affect AI behaviour, the dependency should be visible within the risk assessment.

---

## 25. Risk and Change

Risk must be reassessed when behaviour or operational effect may change.

Potential triggers include:

- model updates;
- retraining;
- fine-tuning;
- data changes;
- software changes;
- infrastructure changes;
- new dependencies;
- changes in autonomy;
- new missions;
- new environments;
- emerging threats.

The key principle is:

> **Behaviour determines change significance.**

A small administrative update may be low risk.

A technically small change that alters consequential behaviour may require extensive reassessment.

---

## 26. Incident-Driven Risk Reassessment

An incident should be treated as evidence that may change the risk position.

Following an incident, the organisation should consider:

1. What happened?
2. Why did it happen?
3. Was the behaviour previously known?
4. Was the behaviour within the validated envelope?
5. Were controls effective?
6. Was human intervention possible?
7. Does the assurance case remain valid?
8. Should operational authority be restricted or suspended?
9. Is further TEVV required?
10. Is reauthorisation required?

---

## 27. Risk Monitoring

Risk monitoring should continue during operational employment.

Monitoring should consider:

- system performance;
- unexpected outputs;
- uncertainty;
- operator overrides;
- near misses;
- incidents;
- security events;
- changes in environment;
- changes in mission;
- changes in data;
- changes in dependencies.

Operational experience should feed back into:

**Risk → Assurance → Authorisation**

---

## 28. Risk Review Triggers

A formal risk review should be considered when:

- authorisation approaches expiry;
- material changes occur;
- mission changes;
- operating conditions change;
- autonomy changes;
- new threats emerge;
- significant incidents occur;
- performance degrades;
- evidence becomes obsolete;
- new vulnerabilities are identified;
- new operational evidence contradicts previous assumptions.

---

## 29. Risk Governance Records

Each consequential capability should maintain traceable records including, as applicable:

- risk assessment;
- assumptions;
- identified hazards;
- failure modes;
- controls;
- control effectiveness;
- inherent risk;
- residual risk;
- uncertainty;
- risk acceptance decision;
- risk owner;
- escalation history;
- review dates;
- incidents;
- changes;
- reassessment outcomes.

These records should connect to the D-AIGAAF Golden Thread.

---

## 30. Risk Ownership

Every material risk should have a named risk owner.

The risk owner should have sufficient authority and knowledge to:

- understand the risk;
- ensure treatment is implemented;
- monitor changes;
- escalate when necessary;
- recommend acceptance, restriction or suspension.

Risk ownership should not be assigned solely to the technical team when the risk is fundamentally operational.

---

## 31. Risk vs Assurance

D-AIGAAF maintains a deliberate distinction.

**Risk asks:**

> What could go wrong, how serious could it be, and under what conditions?

**Assurance asks:**

> What evidence do we have that the capability can perform acceptably and that identified risks are adequately controlled?

Neither replaces the other.

A low apparent risk does not justify poor evidence where consequences are high.

Strong evidence does not eliminate the need for legitimate risk acceptance.

---

## 32. Risk vs Authorisation

Risk assessment informs authorisation.

It does not create authority.

The sequence is:

**Risk Assessment → Risk Treatment → Residual Risk → Assurance → Authorisation Decision**

An authorising authority may:

- authorise;
- conditionally authorise;
- restrict;
- suspend;
- revoke;
- require further evidence.

The decision must be documented.

---

## 33. Risk Governance Decision Logic

The conceptual D-AIGAAF logic is:

```text
Identify Mission
      ↓
Define Capability and Context
      ↓
Identify Consequences
      ↓
Assess Autonomy and Human Control
      ↓
Assess Environment and Mission Criticality
      ↓
Identify Risks and Uncertainties
      ↓
Apply Controls
      ↓
Assess Residual Risk
      ↓
Determine Required Assurance
      ↓
Collect and Evaluate Evidence
      ↓
Determine Whether Risk Is Acceptable
      ↓
Authorise / Restrict / Reject
      ↓
Monitor
      ↓
Reassess on Change or Incident
```

---

## 34. Risk Governance Failure Modes

D-AIGAAF identifies common risk governance failures.

### Risk Blindness

Material risks are not identified.

### Risk Aggregation

A serious risk is hidden inside an apparently acceptable aggregate score.

### Risk Transfer Illusion

Responsibility is assumed to disappear because a supplier or contractor is involved.

### Risk Acceptance by Default

Risk becomes accepted merely because the system continues operating.

### Authority Mismatch

A person accepts risk beyond their delegated authority.

### Evidence Substitution

A risk is declared acceptable because testing was performed, without determining what the evidence actually demonstrates.

### Static Risk Assessment

Risk is treated as fixed despite changes in mission, environment or system behaviour.

### Unknown-Risk Suppression

Uncertainty is hidden rather than recorded.

### Operational Disconnect

Technical risk assessments fail to consider actual employment conditions.

### Accountability Displacement

Responsibility for a governance decision is incorrectly attributed to the AI itself.

---

## 35. Relationship With the Golden Thread

Risk is one of the central links in the D-AIGAAF Golden Thread:

**Mission Need → Risk → Requirements → Controls → Testing → Evidence → Assurance → Authority → Employment → Monitoring → Change / Incident → Reauthorisation**

Risk must therefore remain traceable to:

- mission need;
- requirements;
- controls;
- evidence;
- assurance;
- authority;
- operational outcomes.

If a consequential operational decision cannot be connected to a documented risk position, governance traceability is incomplete.

---

## 36. Relationship With Other Modules

This document provides the organisational risk-governance foundation for:

- `14 Incident & Fail-Safe`
- `15 Change & Reauthorisation`
- `16 Audit & Evidence`
- `21 Legal & Policy`
- `22 Acquisition & Procurement`

---

## 37. Implementation Principle

D-AIGAAF does not prescribe a single universal numerical risk formula.

Organisations implementing the framework should develop detailed scoring or assessment methods appropriate to:

- mission;
- capability;
- consequence;
- autonomy;
- environment;
- organisational risk appetite;
- legal and policy requirements.

Any numerical model should be treated as a decision-support mechanism rather than a substitute for professional judgement and authorised human decision-making.

---

## 38. Summary

D-AIGAAF treats risk governance as a continuous connection between operational purpose and legitimate authority.

The core chain is:

**Mission → Context → Consequence → Risk → Controls → Residual Risk → Assurance → Authority**

Risk governance must ensure that:

- important risks are visible;
- uncertainty is explicit;
- controls are tested;
- residual risk is understood;
- the right authority accepts the risk;
- operational conditions remain within the authorised envelope;
- incidents and changes trigger reassessment.

The governing principle is:

> **No consequential operational authority without an explicit understanding of the risk that authority creates and the evidence supporting its acceptance.**

**Status:** Working Draft v0.1  
**Next review:** Following development of the detailed `03 Risk & Autonomy` module.
